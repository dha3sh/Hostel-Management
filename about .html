		<h1>Welcome to NBKRIST Hostels</h1>


<p class=a>The quality of life is one of the most important factors considered by the students deciding to stay
in the College hostels. By quality, it is not just the rooms but also the overall environment 
of the campus.Life on campus helps the students not only to study but also to socialize with the peers. 
Friendships formed on the campus last a lifetime. NBKRIST provides a comfortable and safe housing to all its students. 
The students housed in the campus are encouraged to use the gym, playground, and all indoor gaming facilities.</p>
